# Data Structures in Python 📚

Welcome to my **Data Structures** repository! This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures. Each folder contains code and examples for different types of data structures that are commonly used in computer science.

## 🚀 Projects

- **Linked Lists**: A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
- **Stacks**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queues**: A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Binary Trees**: A tree structure where each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left and right child.
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.
- **Hash Tables**: A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: The language used for all the implementations in this repository.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for all projects to provide an interactive environment for writing and testing code, visualizing outputs, and documenting the process.
- **Unit Tests**: Some of the projects include unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementations.
